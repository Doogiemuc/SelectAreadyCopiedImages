# Mac Finder Service: Select alreay copied images

This is a Service for the Mac Finder. It selects all files (eg. JPG images) in the frontmost finder window that already exist under a certain directory. The selected files can then be moved or deleted with Mac Finder.

I use this workflow to copy pictures from my digital camera's SD card onto my local "Pictures" folder. The Service shows me all picture files that already exist on my local disk.

# Install

Copy the Service folder to `~/Library/Services/` under your home folder on your Mac.

# Usage

 - Open Mac Finder
 - Navigate to a folder that contains your images (eg. the SD card)
 - Right click -> Services -> SelectAlreadyCopied Images
 - All images that already exist locally will be selected.
 - Now you may for example delete this images from the SD card.
